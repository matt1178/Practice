These files were created by Microsoft Visual Studio C# 2010 Express. It's free and doesn't suck, you should look into it. We should definitely get on the same code platform (I'm open to suggestions if any of you prefer something different) to streamline things.

Also, add your name at the end of this so I know you can get into the repository correctly.
