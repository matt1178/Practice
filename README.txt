This project is a practice for whenever it is that we start making mods for Space Station 13. The main goal is to get Git set up, make sure everyone knows how to edit the project, and asses the coding ability of everyone on the team. The way we're going to do this is a little C# hangman game. It is being made in Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express (so download that if you don't have it).

Add your name to the end of this file to confirm that you're able to make changes. Have questions? Join us in #spacestation13 on irc.synirc.net.
